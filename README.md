UCI-HAR-data-analysis
=====================

This repo is for the course project in Coursera’s “Getting and Cleaning Data”. A description of the files used and processing performed on UCI's "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" is provided in the project's README.pdf. A codebook is also included in PDF format, instead of markdown (md).

PDF was chosen for these files because it expedited editing of more tabular and/or graphical documentation for the project. I hope you will appreciate that ;-)
